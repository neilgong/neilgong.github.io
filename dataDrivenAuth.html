                        Social systems today most commonly rely on passwords to authenticate users. Unfortunately, two serious issues in this paradigm are: 1) users will inevitably forget their passwords, and 2) their passwords could be compromised by attackers. Therefore, service providers often provide users with backup authentication mechanisms to solve the first issue and adopt auxiliary authentication mechanisms (they are launched when suspicious account activities are detected) to mitigate the second issue. Given the increasing availability of users' social data, social systems like Facebook are beginning to leverage social data to design more secure and usable backup and auxiliary authentication mechanisms. Based on how the social data is used, we classify social data based authentication mechanisms into <i>trustee-based social authentication</i> (used for backup authentication) and <i>knowledge-based social authentication</i> (used for auxiliary authentication). For instance, Facebook launched a trustee-based social authentication system called <i>Trusted Contacts</i> in May, 2013, and Facebook also has a knowledge-based social authentication system called <i>social authentication</i> in use since January, 2011; Microsoft researchers implemented a trustee-based social authentication prototype and integrated it into Microsoft's Windows Live ID system.   
                        
                       
                        However, current widely used backup authentication mechanisms such as security questions and alternate email addresses are insecure or unreliable or both. To mitigate the attack damage of the second issue, service providers often adopt an auxiliary authentication mechanism to further verify the identities of the users when they detect suspicious activities on the accounts. However, widely adopted auxiliary authentication mechanisms including CAPTCHA and security questions are also shown to have low security and usability guarantees.

                        Our work aims to make trustee-based social authentications and knowledge-based social authentications more secure and usable. In particular,  we proposed new attacks to trustee-based social authentications, a probabilistic security model to formalize the threat of the attacks and their costs for attackers, and defenses against the attacks. Our results have strong implications for the design of more secure trustee-based social authentications. Our ongoing researches focus on designing more secure and usable knowledge-based social authentications.

                        Social systems today most commonly rely on passwords to authenticate users. Two well-known issues in this paradigm are that users will inevitably forget their passwords, and that passwords could be compromised and changed by attackers. As a result, users cannot access their own accounts and lose all the data associated with the accounts. Therefore, service providers often provide a backup authentication mechanism for users to recover accounts. Since existing backup authentication mechanisms such as security questions and alternate emails were shown to be insecure or unreliable or both, social systems aim to leverage social data to design backup authentication mechanisms, i.e., social authentication. For instance, Facebook launched a social authentication system called Trusted Contacts in May 2013. In this mechanism, a user selects a few social friends as his/her trustees who will later help the user to recover his/her lost or compromised account.

                        I provided a systematic study about the security of trustee-based social authentication mechanisms. In particular, I identified that, unlike other authentication mechanisms, users' security in trustee-based social authentication is correlated, i.e., if a user's trustees are compromised, then the user will also be compromised. Based on this key observation, I proposed a new probabilistic security model to quantify the expected number of users that can be compromised by an attacker with a given resource. I also introduced various attacks and defenses, and I evaluated them quantitatively using my security model on a few social network datasets. My results have strong implications for the design of more secure trustee-based social authentication mechanisms including Facebook's Trusted Contacts.
